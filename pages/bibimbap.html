    <p>This bibimbap recipe makes a popular and delicious Korean meal. Meaning mixed rice, bibimbap is a delicious rice bowl topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red chili pepper paste). Traditionally, bibimbap was eaten on the eve of the Lunar New Year, to use up any leftovers before the start of the new year.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumbers: This bibimap recipe starts with cucumbers, cut into matchsticks, mixed with gochujang (optional, but it adds subtle heat). </li>
        <li>Vegetables: You’ll also need spinach, cut into thin strips, and carrots, cut into matchsticks. </li>
        <li>Soy sauce: Soy sauce lends umami-rich flavor. </li>
        <li>Olive oil: Cook the carrots and garlic in olive oil.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Take the flavor up a notch with fresh garlic and dried red pepper flakes. </li>
        <li>Steak: This recipe calls for thinly-sliced beef — top round steak is rich and beefy, which makes it perfect for bibimbap.</li>
        <li>Eggs: You’ll need one whole egg per serving.</li>
        <li>Rice: Ladle each serving over bibimbap over a cup of cooked white rice.</li>
        <li>Sesame oil: Toasting the sesame oil brings out a depth of flavor. </li>
        <li>Sesame seeds: A teaspoon of sesame seeds are the perfect finishing touch. </li>
    </ul>
